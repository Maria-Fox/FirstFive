## Tech Stack

The backend was built using Express, Node, Sequelize, and JSON web tokens. Passwords abd encrypted using BCRYPT.

## Utilizing Routes

- The base URL for requests is: https://firstfive.herokuapp.com

Most routes are private and require a user token. To begin:
POST `/auth/register`

` {
  "username" : "sampleUser",
  "password: "password123",
  "email:" "email@sample.com",
